#Directions
This is a pong game and the main idea behind this program is to make the 
computer loose. Points can be gained by either the computer or the 
user by making the ball pass either side of the each other's screen.

There are three phases to this game, and they include the start screen
which has a button the user has to press to begin playing the game.
The game screen which has the two paddles and a ball. The user has to
use the up and down arrow key on the keyboard to control the paddle where as
the computer controls it own paddle to avoid the ball from passing without getting hit.
The last screen which has the score and information how the game 
ended. It also has a second button that allows you to play again and 
this takes you  to the first screen to be able to start a new game.

Keys and Buttons needed. 
To begin the actual game the user will use the left mouse button to
click on the button and the same way when it comes to playing again.
During the game, the user will use the up and down arrow key to basically 
move the paddle up and down to the direction of the ball.   

How to Win
To score a point the user has to get the ball across the field
where the cpu cannot hit it. The first to get to five points win the 
entire game and you could play again i you are willing to with the 
help of the play again button.
